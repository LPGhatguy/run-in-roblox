# run-in-roblox
**Early WIP, nothing interesting here yet.**

run-in-roblox is a tool to run a place, a model, or an individual script inside the local installation of Roblox Studio.

run-in-roblox pipes output from inside Roblox Studio back to stdout/stderr, which enables traditional automation tools to work alongside Roblox.

# Installation

Use cargo to install the executable with the following command.

```
cargo install run-in-roblox
```
